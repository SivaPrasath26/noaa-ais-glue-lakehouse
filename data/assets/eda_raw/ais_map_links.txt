AIS Geospatial Map Links
--------------------------------------------------

These links provide interactive HTML maps generated from raw AIS geospatial signal data for two separate NOAA AIS data days.
Each file visualizes vessel positions across U.S. waters, created during the exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase.

Both visualizations are built from NOAA Automatic Identification System (AIS) geospatial data and show real ship positions across coastal and inland waterways.
